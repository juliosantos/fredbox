Fredbox is a Meteor app which allows partygoers to submit and upvote tracks for a DJ to play. The crowd submits songs and upvotes them, creating a preference-oriented queue.

With Fredbox, people can:

* search for songs available in Spotify (with autocomplete)
* submit songs to the queue
* upvote songs
* know what song is now playing
* revive songs which have already been played

The DJ can enter DJ mode by entering the Konami code and:

* play songs via the Spotify Play button (assuming Spotify is installed)
* trash unwanted songs
